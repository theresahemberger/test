    <h3>&bull; Netflix Reccomendations &bull;</h3>
    <p>Binge watching is my favorite thing to do when I have off-days or on the weekends. I love getting so invested in shows and just escaping reality. There are so many amazing shows on Netflix and Hulu so I wanted to share some of my favorites with you. Some of these shows are relatively new but some of these have been on Netflix for a very long time, but they are still totally binge-worthy</p>

    <h3>&bull; Yoga &bull;</h3>
    <p> I have never been the type of person to enjoy yoga very much. I always thought it was more painful than enjoyable. However, recently I have taken the time to practice yoga some more and I have realized that it has so many benefits. You can easily do it in the comfort of your own home and you need to equipment. If you are someone who struggles to just relax and slow down sometimes, I definitely recommend giving yoga a try. I have linked two of my favorite at home yoga classes below but there are so many on YouTube

    <h3>&bull; Book Reccomendations &bull;</h3>
    <p>My whole life I have not been very good at just sitting down and reading a book. It never lasts more than 30 minutes for me. However, there are a few books that I have come across that I could not put down. Reading is so beneficial and can be so calming. My favorite place to read is in the summer by the pool because I can get that sun-kissed look and read at the same time. Whatâ€™s better than that!</p>
    <p>My Top Three Books:</p>
