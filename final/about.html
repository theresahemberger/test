          Hi! I'm Theresa. I'm a 19 year old college student at the University of Miami with a great passion for fashion, beauty and everything of that sort. I decided that it was time for me to take this passion and do something useful with it so I created this blog! I have compiled all my best tips and suggestions and put them all in one place, easy and accesible for everyone. Feel free to reach out through email or social media, I would love to get to know every single one of you. Thank you so much for checking out Felicity, it's a pleasure to have you here.
